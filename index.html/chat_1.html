<h1> DATA SCIENCE</h1>
<hr>
<tbody>Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data,[1][2] and apply knowledge and actionable insights from data across a broad range of application domains. Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data.</tbody>
    Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.[3] It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge. However, data science is different from computer science and information science. Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge.
    <section>
<tbody>In 1962, John Tukey described a field he called "data analysis", which resembles modern data science.[16] In 1985, in a lecture given to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, C.F. Jeff Wu used the term Data Science for the first time as an alternative name for statistics.[17] Later, attendees at a 1992 statistics symposium at the University of Montpellier II acknowledged the emergence of a new discipline focused on data of various origins and forms, combining established concepts and principles of statistics and data analysis with computing.[18][19]

    The term "data science" has been traced back to 1974, when Peter Naur proposed it as an alternative name for computer science.[20] In 1996, the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic.[20] However, the definition was still in flux. After the 1985 lecture in the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in 1997 C.F. Jeff Wu again suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting, or limited to describing data.[21] In 1998, Hayashi Chikio argued for data science as a new, interdisciplinary concept, with three aspects: data design, collection, and analysis.[19]
    
    During the 1990s, popular terms for the process of finding patterns in datasets (which were increasingly large) included "knowledge discovery" and "data mining"</tbody>

             <h1>What does a data scientist do?</h1>
             <br>  
            <tbody>Data science combines various disciplines such as data analysis, data engineering, mathematics, statistics, domain expertise, advanced computing, visualization, and much more. A data scientist is expected to have mastery in four fundamental areas: business/domain, mathematics, computer science, and communication.

                Thus, a data scientist is someone who can leverage the seemingly infinite amount of data to achieve business goals. They are expected to uncover the latest trends in unstructured data through microscopic attention and analysis. The analysis is followed by effective communication and interpretation of the results, enabling the organization to drive change. </tbody>
